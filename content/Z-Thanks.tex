I'd like to thank my supervisor Steffen Schumann for giving me the chance to be a part of this interesting project as well as for his encouragement and for always trying his best in answering my various questions.
Furthermore I'm very grateful for the support from Enrico Bothmann, who helped me with the technical aspects of my study and never hesitated to provide me the required information or to take a deeper look at my issues.
Without his help, I would not have come as far as I did during the time of my thesis.
